# ep-clutter-example
A demonstration of Expectation Propagation.  This code runs EP and competing algorithms on the clutter problem from my thesis.  `test_clutter.m` runs the algorithms.
Infer.NET also has this example, in [ClutterTest](https://github.com/dotnet/infer/blob/d4966ec295490b1d6c087b7c7e8abf17609bdf59/test/Tests/MixtureTests.cs#L234)
